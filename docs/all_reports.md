# All Reports

All reports share the same base output columns, which occur before the special columns listed in each document.

## Shared Output Columns

- primary_publishing_organisation
- publishing_app
- document_type
- schema_type
- first_published_at

- status (published/withdrawn/historical)

## Validity

Note that some reports will output good and bad items, some (mostly newer reports) will only output bad items. See the individual Validity section of the docs for each report.
